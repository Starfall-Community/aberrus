# Kazzara, the Hellforged

Kazzara the Hellforged is the first boss of Aberrus, the Shadowed Crucible.

The following information is from the 10.1.0 PTR and possibly wrong for the 10.1.0 release.

## Abilities

#### [Hellsteel Carnage](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr/spell=401319/hellsteel-carnage?dd=15&ddsize=30)

Kazzara uses this ability as specific health thresholds are reached.

Inflicts raid-wide damage, and causes [Infernal Heart](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr/spell=408367/infernal-heart) which is a raid-wide DOT.

Periodically spawns [Hellsteel Fragment](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr/spell=402461/hellsteel-fragment?dd=15&ddsize=30) and [Revenant's Blood](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr/spell=404789/revenants-blood?dd=15&ddsize=30) on arena.

#### [Dread Rifts](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr/spell=407196/dread-rifts?dd=15&ddsize=30)

Targets random players which will drop a puddle after 5 seconds. Dropping the puddle does damage to any other players within 5 yards. Puddle does damage while standing in it.

Use the puddles to remove [Rays of Anguish](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr/spell=407069/rays-of-anguish?dd=15&ddsize=30).

#### [Rays of Anguish](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr/spell=407069/rays-of-anguish?dd=15&ddsize=30)

Targets random player(s) and sends a red arrow after them that inflicts damage and drops fire puddles on the ground.

(Heroic/Mythic) Kite into [Dread Rifts](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr/spell=407196/dread-rifts?dd=15&ddsize=30) to remove it.
(Mythic-only) Avoid crossing the path other arrows have taken, this causes raid-wide damage.

#### [Hellbeam](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr/spell=400430/hellbeam?dd=15&ddsize=30)

Kazzara uses this ability when reaching 100 energy.

Target random player and shoots dragons breath in their direction, this will inflict damage and a DOT on anyone caught in it.
The heat of the breath also puts a DOT on everyone in the raid.

#### [Wings of Extinction](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr/spell=403326/wings-of-extinction?dd=15&ddsize=30)

Small knockback, inflicts damage and gives a damage over time debuff.

#### [Terror Claws](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr/spell=404744/terror-claws?dd=15&ddsize=30)

Targets who currently holds aggro (which is hopefully a tank).

Inflicts damage, gives a damage over time debuff, and gives a debuff increasing damage of next [Terror Claws](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr/spell=404744/terror-claws?dd=15&ddsize=30).

## Strategies

### Everyone

Lightly spread to avoid [Rays of Anguish](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr/spell=407069/rays-of-anguish?dd=15&ddsize=30) that are targetting other players.

Be aware of surroundings when Kazzara casts [Wings of Extinction](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr/spell=403326/wings-of-extinction?dd=15&ddsize=30), the small knockback can knock you into puddles. Avoid this.

At 100% energy, she will turn from the tanks direction to a random player and start casting [Hellbeam](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr/spell=400430/hellbeam?dd=15&ddsize=30).
Once casting, her direction is locked, so dodge left or right if within the cone.

There is plenty of space for [Dread Rifts](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr/spell=407196/dread-rifts?dd=15&ddsize=30) drops, but don't put them too far away from the boss as these are needed to remove [Rays of Anguish](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr/spell=407069/rays-of-anguish?dd=15&ddsize=30).

### Tank

Tank with boss pointing away from raid. This makes [Hellbeam](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr/spell=400430/hellbeam?dd=15&ddsize=30) much easier to notice as she will do large turns.

Swap after each [Terror Claws](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr/spell=404744/terror-claws?dd=15&ddsize=30).
